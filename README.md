# Welcome to Foam2D Project
Desktop controller is based on C# for controlling the microcontroller, which is STM32 family. The Microcontroller need separate language, so i use C for programming the [Embedded System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system#:~:text=An%20embedded%20system%20is%20a,larger%20mechanical%20or%20electronic%20system.). This project target is creating a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) for Foam Designer that using [G-Code]  to control the system path and movement. For the desktop controller, it can parse the G-Code so the Embedded System can Actuate the workbench tool such as Stepper Motor, Element Heater, etc.
